## Testing

```
make test
```

or

```
forge test
```

# Deploying to a network

Deploying to a network uses the [foundry scripting system](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html), where you write your deploy scripts in solidity!


## Deploying

```
make deploy-wallaby contract=<CONTRACT_NAME>
```

For example:

```
make deploy-wallaby contract=PriceFeedConsumer
```

This will run the forge script, the script it's running is:

```
@forge script script/${contract}.s.sol:Deploy${contract} --rpc-url ${WALLABY_RPC_URL}  --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY} --broadcast   -vvvv
```

If you don't have an `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`, you can also just run:

```
@forge script script/${contract}.s.sol:Deploy${contract} --rpc-url ${WALLABY_RPC_URL}  --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY} --broadcast 
```

These pull from the files in the `script` folder. 

### Working with a local network

Foundry comes with local network [anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/index.html) baked in, and allows us to deploy to our local network for quick testing locally. 

To start a local network run:

```
make anvil
```

This will spin up a local blockchain with a determined private key, so you can use the same private key each time. 

Then, you can deploy to it with:

```
make deploy-anvil contract=<CONTRACT_NAME>
```

Similar to `deploy-goerli`

### Working with other chains

To add a chain, you'd just need to make a new entry in the `Makefile`, and replace `<YOUR_CHAIN>` with whatever your chain's information is. 

```
deploy-<YOUR_CHAIN> :; @forge script script/${contract}.s.sol:Deploy${contract} --rpc-url ${<YOUR_CHAIN>_RPC_URL}  --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY} --broadcast -vvvv

```

# Security

This framework comes with slither parameters, a popular security framework from [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/). To use slither, you'll first need to [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [install slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither#how-to-install).

Then, you can run:

```
make slither
```

And get your slither output.
